# BIOL-653-Honig-Aaron
This repository contains homework assignments for BIO 653, Fall 2015 and other associated files.
I am changing my README file on R Studio. 
*I love RMarkdown*
**No, really, it doesn't suck at all**
~~it's terrible~~

* I added a README file to my online github repository
* I pulled it onto my computer using the terminal command _git pull origin master_
* I opened R Studio to edit the downloaded file
* I used _git add_ and _git commit -m 'message'_ to save the edited version
* I pushed the new version to GitHub using _git push origin master_
* I re-edited the README.md file in R Studio before pushing the new version
